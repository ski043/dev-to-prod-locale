      <h2>Garlic bread with cheese: What the science tells us</h2>
      <p>
        For years parents have espoused the health benefits of eating garlic
        bread with cheese to their children, with the food earning such an
        iconic status in our culture that kids will often dress up as warm,
        cheesy loaf for Halloween.
      </p>
      <p>
        But a recent study shows that the celebrated appetizer may be linked to
        a series of rabies cases springing up around the country.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        &ldquo;The correlation between garlic bread consumption and rabies
        incidents is undeniable,&rdquo; says Dr. Sarah Matthews, lead researcher
        at the Institute for Questionable Food Science. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve
        documented over 47 cases in the past month alone.&rdquo;
      </blockquote>

      <h3>The Research Methodology</h3>
      <p>
        The study, conducted over a rigorous 3-week period, involved tracking
        the eating habits of 12 volunteers who agreed to consume nothing but
        garlic bread for the duration of the experiment.
      </p>

      <h4>Key Findings Include:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          100% of subjects developed an inexplicable urge to howl at the moon
        </li>
        <li>87% reported suddenly loving belly rubs</li>
        <li>73% began chasing delivery trucks</li>
        <li>
          45% started referring to their mailman as &ldquo;the enemy&rdquo;
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        However, critics argue that the study&rsquo;s sample size was
        insufficient and that correlation does not imply causation. Dr. James
        Wilson from the University of Common Sense pointed out several flaws in
        the methodology.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        &ldquo;This is the most ridiculous thing I&rsquo;ve ever read. Have they
        considered that maybe people who eat nothing but garlic bread for three
        weeks might just be... unwell to begin with?&rdquo;
      </blockquote>

      <h3>Historical Context</h3>
      <p>
        Garlic bread has been a staple of questionable dietary choices since the
        early 1970s, when Italian-American restaurants began serving it as a way
        to use day-old bread that was too stale for anything else.

      <h3>Expert Opinions</h3>
      <p>
        The medical community remains divided on whether garlic bread poses any
        real threat to public health. Some experts suggest that the real danger
        lies not in the bread itself, but in people&rsquo;s willingness to
        believe anything they read on the internet.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been eating garlic bread for 40 years and I&rsquo;m
        perfectly fine,&rdquo; says local resident Margaret Thompson, while
        inexplicably sniffing the reporter&rsquo;s hand and wagging her tail.
      </blockquote>

      <h3>Recommendations</h3>
      <p>
        Until further research can be conducted, health officials recommend
        moderation when consuming garlic bread with cheese. They also suggest
        avoiding full moons after consumption and keeping a safe distance from
        fire hydrants.
